# Connected 2 Truth

Pilate, the Roman Governor asked Jesus, “What is truth?”<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup> In our world today, this question is still relevant and hard to answer. The Father gave us His Word so we won't be in darkness. Many times we want to understand the Bible but just don't know where to start. This app is designed to equip and strengthen you as you grow in your faith. It is designed to give you a better understanding of the Truth of Messiah and to understand the Truth of our Father's heart. With a weekly reading, this app will show you the message of the whole Bible from the beginning to the end. It starts in the Torah and pulls you through passages that are related in the writings or the prophets and then pulls the same thread through the New Testament to give you a view of the Scripture like never before. Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah is the Word made flesh. May His Word guide you, teach you, and connect you to all Truth.
